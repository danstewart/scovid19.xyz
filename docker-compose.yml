# This file has two versions of the app
# One for dev and one for prod
# Everything is managed by control.sh - so please use that rather than calling docker-compose manually
# Main differences for the dev version are
# - Only one port is exposed since we don't need to scale in dev mode
# - The local src/ directory is mounted to src/ in the container for easy editing
